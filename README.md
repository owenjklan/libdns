## DNS Client library with no dependencies ##
```libdns``` is my 're-invention of the wheel' DNS client resolver
library, written entirely in C with no external dependencies.

Supports UDP as transport protocol only (Meaning, no Zone Transfers).

I even wrote a man page.

Supplied with an example client application: ```dnsq```.

### Do note... ###
This code is presented nearly as-is from when it was written back
in 2003. The world and my abilities have come a long way in over
16 years...
